title: My Preformance in the Twitch Rivals

I was in Team Graycens. Yeah I know I am pretty cool. Tho it didn't went as planned since Emiru and Mizkif left me. But as you know I am a [make-a-wish](https://worldwish.org/) kid so since I couldn't be left out I got paired with [Buttsoap](https://twitch.tv/buttsoap) & [Bean](https://twitch.tv/bean). My preforamnce was really good in my opinion and we placed on a really good spot and as a whole overview on it we did really well. If I would rate myself on a scale from 1 to 10 I would say we preformed a strong 9/10. The placement was really good and I was really happy with it.
