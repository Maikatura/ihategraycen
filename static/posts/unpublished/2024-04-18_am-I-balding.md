<img src="/static/media/Baldcen.png#rightwrap" alt="Loser">
Okay for somedays ago I wake up everyday with more and more hair in my bed am I balding. I have heard when you hit the rock bottom of your life your hair starts to fall off. I am rand(63, 81) years old but I dont think I would start balding at this age... I feel kinda sad. But could you rate me? Do you think it looks bad?
